# Introduction

![Counties of North Carolina](assets/north_carolina.png)

The primary motivation of this report is to provide key determinants of crime in the state of North Carolina for 


# Data Loading and Cleaning

All data are mainly for 1987 except *percent minority* which is for 1980.

# EDA (Model Building Process)


The outcome variable of our study is (crmrte) which is coded as "crimes per person".



- What do you want to measure? Make sure you identify variables that will be relevant to the concerns of the political campaign.

- What covariates help you identify a causal effect?

- What covariates are problematic, either due to multicollinearity, or because they will absorb some of a causal effect you want to measure?

- What transformations should you apply to each variable? This is very important because transformations can reveal linearities in the data, make our results relevant, or help us meet model assumptions.

- Are your choices supported by EDA?

# Ommitted Variables

# Conclusion

- Does the conclusion address the high-level concerns of a political campaign?
- Is the discussion connected to whether the key effects are real or whether they may be solely an artifact of omitted variable bias?
